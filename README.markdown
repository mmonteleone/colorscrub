Color Scrub
===========
A quick look at your palette  
http://michaelmonteleone.net/colorscrub  

A quick hack tool which shows a distinct set of all colors mentioned by a source text, whether they're in hex, rgb, or other formats.  Can accept raw text or a URL to a remote source like a CSS file (thanks to YQL).
